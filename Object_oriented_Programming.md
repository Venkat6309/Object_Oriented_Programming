# Object Oriented Programming concepts
&rarr;&nbsp; This concepts are used to represents the real world objects into a program.<br>
&rarr;&nbsp;The real world objects can be recoginzed by its properties and behaviors.<br>
&rarr;&nbsp;This properties of a **object** are represented as    **"Global variables"** and **behaviours** are represented as **"Methods"**.<br>
&rarr;&nbsp;If the properties are changing from object to object then we ha sto declared them as **"non static global variables"**, if they are common to all the objects then we have to declared them as **"static global variables"**.<br>
&rarr; If a method is using any non static property then it is recommended to declare the method as **"Non-static "** other wise it declare it as **"Static"**.<br>

### Real World Objects
#### Car: 
 - Properties: <br>
 &rarr;&nbsp;**Brand**<br>
 &rarr;&nbsp;**Cost**<br>
 &rarr;&nbsp;**Color**<br>
 
 - Behavior :<br>
 &rarr;&nbsp;**Start( )**<br>
 &rarr;&nbsp;**Accelerate( )**<br>
 &rarr;&nbsp;**Brake( )**<br>
 &rarr;&nbsp;**Stop( )**<br>
 &rarr;&nbsp;**Drift( )**<br>
